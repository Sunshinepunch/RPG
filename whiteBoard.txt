Character creation:
Character constructor will have properties - name (type), stats (array), index position, xp, level
Stats Array : Default (Custom)= 100 points split across three elements


Style array contains - , damage, defense, hp

3 Styles: Way of the Dragon, Turtle, Monkey
Dragon (Offense) - [50, 20, 30]
Turtle (Defense) - [20, 40, 40]
Monkey (Balance) - [30, 30, 40]

Damage = modifier that adds 10% of itself to roll


Battle system
Dice Roll System (start at HP stat and go to zero)
Conditions for winning (hp not zero, other hp = zero)
Combat = d20 rolled until hp hits zero (in turns)
Combat = roll dice + attack modifier - enemy defense modifier = amount subtracted from HP
Each roll displays a random anime saying (WHERE ARE YOU GETTING ALL OF THIS POWER)(THIS ISNT EVEN MY FINAL FORM)(ETC ETC)

Level up
Winning battles earns XP, XP changes level (level counter that goes up after battle)
leveling increases damage, defense (every level, extra die roll)




1 button - attack
1 button - explore (can do a number of times equal to level) % chance to find item/legendary encounter/rest (d100 - heal > item > nothing > doggo)
1 button - Travel to Dojo (starts boss fight)


dojo [face to foot style, Right leg Gym, Ancestral index finger, both legs Jim, last boss ]

Game ends if - you die because hp = 0, OR you kill last boss

STRETCH GOALS:

Refactor Code - replace myStats with object with damage, defense, hp properties

Special Moves:
Add special moves as an optional attack to select (with some kind of resource management)

Custom Character:
Create a default block of [30, 30, 30] that allows user to assign 10 to any value
  - maybe make even more custom? its a stretch either way

Inventory:
inventory affects the base value of the die roll : sword = damage +1, armor = damage -1
Inventory {great, good, ok}, random chance (20%, 50%, 30%)
